\begin{theorem}
No graph can be simultaneously a forest and non-bipartite.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
A forest is an acyclic graph. A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd
cycle. Since a forest contains no cycles at all, it contains no odd cycles in particular,
so it is bipartite.

Therefore, if a graph is a forest, it must be bipartite, and the assignment
$\{\text{forest} = T, \text{bipartite} = F\}$ is contradictory.
\end{proof}
